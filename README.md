# Se


The Se (Chinese: 瑟) is an ancient Chinese plucked [zither](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zither) (string instrument). It has 25–50 strings with moveable bridges and a range of up to five octaves. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Se_(instrument))

Use this as a name because we sometimes want to save **so many** quick links, like when using GitLab, we want to open:

```
https://github.com/{username}/{different project}

https://github.com/{username}/{project}/{different branch}

https://github.com/{username}/{project}/{branch}/{issues, PR...}

...
```

and if save all those in Bookmarks, sometimes just make things a mess.

And, there is a Chinese poetry with Se which is about time and beautiful memories.
